#Wikipedia Viewer

This is a rework of my local weather project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). Did this in scope of the [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/yOoMarvin/100-days-of-code) challenge.

With this webapp you can search for a specific wikipedia article or get a random one.
